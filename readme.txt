== Description ==

Create an Android and iOS app for your WordPress website. It takes just 5 minutes and doesn't require coding. The best part? It updates automatically, when you make a change on your website, so you won't need to manually maintain the app. When you turn your website into an app with webtoapp.design, we handle all the technical stuff for you and guide you through every step from creating to publishing your app in the app stores.

This plugin allows you to quickly send push notifications to your app users. [Please note that you need to create an app on webtoapp.design before you can use this plugin.](https://webtoapp.design/convert/app_details?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=description)

[Features of this plugin](https://webtoapp.design/blog/wordpress-plugin?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=description):

- Instead of sending push notifications through tne webtoapp.design dashboard you can now send them directly from your WordPress admin panel. You probably spend quite a bit of time in your WordPress admin dashboard, so we hope this added convenience of being able to send notifications straight from there is useful to you.
- You can directly select the page from your website that should be opened in the app when a user clicks on the notification. No more copy and pasting URLs from your website to the webtoapp.design dashboard.
- You can select any image from your website using the WordPress image library to attach it to a push notification. So you no longer need to search for the link to the image you want to use, you can just click the image and it fills out the link automatically for you.
- Automatically send a push notification each time you publish a new post. No more wasting time manually sending a notification every time you write a new article. This feature uses the post title as the notification title and attaches the post's featured image to the notification. The notification will be sent out as soon as you mark a page as public, so your drafts are unaffected.
