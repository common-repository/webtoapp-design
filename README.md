# webtoapp-wordpress
This WordPress plugin allows you to access the push notification features of webtoapp.design directly from your WordPress admin dashboard. You can manually send notifications ([like from your webtoapp.design dashboard](https://webtoapp.design/blog/send-push-notification)) and use the dropdown menu to make the notification open a specific page of your website when a user clicks it. Additionally you can attach images from your media library to the notification.

Another neat feature is automatically sending a push notification when you publish a new post ([which was previously only possible through Zapier](https://webtoapp.design/blog/zapier-integration)).

You can find the plugin in the [WordPress plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webtoapp-design/).

# What even is webtoapp.design?
webtoapp.design allows you to convert your WordPress website into an app for Android and iOS. (Actually it works with any website, but I assume you are most interested in WordPress).
